.SH DESCRIPTION
.B elsi 
is a tool that is designed to estimate Lustre striping impact on scientific checkpointing applications

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -s,--stripeSize
Controls the chunk size that would be given to Lustre\'s setstripe utility. Specified by appending 'k', 'm', or 'g' to the size desired e.g. "50m" for 50 Megabytes or "2k" for 2 Kilobytes

.IP -c,--stripeCount
Controls the number of chunks that would be given to Lustre\'s setstripe utility

.IP -S,--fileSize
Controls the total file size that you want to created. Specified by appending 'B', 'KB', 'MB', 'GB', or 'TB' to the size desired e.g. "50GB" for a 50 Gigabyte file or "2TB" for a 2 Terabyte file. The size of file that is capable of being made depends on how many nodes that are being used. You add 25GB to the possible file size per node e.g. 5 nodes can make a maximum file size of 125GB and 100 nodes can make a maximum file size of 2500GB. The size values must be given in whole numbers e.g. "2560GB" is OK while "2.5TB" is not
